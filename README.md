# Welcome to the React + TypeScript + Vite Playground!

This repository serves as a testing ground for exploring cutting-edge UI solutions and their potential applications.

## Unstyled UI libraries

In this repository, I've explored various cutting-edge UI libraries without styles but equipped with essential logic. Here are the solutions I've implemented:

### Headless UI by Tailwind Labs

[Headless UI](https://headlessui.com) by Tailwind Labs offers UI libraries without predefined styles, focusing on logic implementation. I experimented with the Transition and Combobox components. However, I encountered complexities with TypeScript integration of Combobox, which led to [an issue](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui/issues/2438). As a result, I found the package's applicability somewhat limited.

### Radix Primitives by Radix

[Radix Primitives](https://radix-ui.com/primitives) is an intriguing package that provides components like Scrollable, Label, Checkbox, and Popover. What sets it apart is the ability to use micro-repos for specific components, offering flexibility and only incorporating necessary elements.

### Downshift Select

[Downshift](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift) stands out as the sole library providing a complete logic architecture for building custom select fields (single/multiple select with possibility of text filtering). Leveraging three hooks, it allows comprehensive customization of select functionalities.

## React design patterns

In addition to experimenting with cutting-edge UI solutions, this repository also delves into exploring design patterns within React applications. Two patterns that have been implemented and explored are the Context API and the Strategy pattern.

### Context API in React

The [Context API](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) in React enables the passing of data through the component tree without explicitly passing props at every level. It facilitates the creation of global data stores accessible by any component in the application. I've leveraged the Context API to manage and provide certain data or settings throughout different parts of the application, enhancing its scalability and maintainability.

### Strategy Pattern in React

The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows selecting an algorithm at runtime from a family of algorithms. In the context of React, this pattern can be employed to encapsulate varying behaviors within components and dynamically select the appropriate strategy based on certain conditions or user interactions. Implementing the Strategy pattern in React facilitates cleaner, more maintainable, and adaptable code by decoupling specific behaviors from the main components.

### Future exploration

Throughout this exploration of design patterns, the aim has been to enhance the maintainability, scalability, and flexibility of React applications. Further experiments and documentation on various other design patterns in the React ecosystem are planned to enrich the understanding and usage of these powerful concepts in real-world applications.
